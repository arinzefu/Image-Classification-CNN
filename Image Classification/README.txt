I got the dataset from google images and I ran it to problems with saving the model, I got a good accuracy for the model
 it was inspired by the image classify done by Nicholas Renotte. It has 4 classes and used 2 frameworks for two different notebooks; tensorflow and pytorch.
 The tensorflow's notebook was more detailed and i created my cnn model while the pytorch notebook i used the Resnet18 model and trained for 3 epochs.
 I advise you to train for longer because you will get a better accuracy, I just was not patient enough to wait for it to set for a reasonable epoch size.
